We are betting that radically declining launch costs, and increasingly capable infrastructure on Mars and the Moon (such as shared communications relay or charging facilities) could open up the possibility of an open-source space program based on low-cost rovers.</p> <p>Rover technology is also strongly aligned with terrestrial autonomous robot technology, in applications such as package delivery, search-and-rescue, and elder-care. The inputs required for these applications, such as efficient batteries, advanced motors, and robust software stacks, are increasingly becoming commoditized and low-cost, lowering barriers to entry. We believe open-source pursuit of the demanding engineering capabilities required for space applications will have significant spin-off benefits for these other applications, and allow independent makers and consultants to develop the kinds of skills that are currently limited to members of advanced corporate and government research laboratories.</p>"},{"location":"elegoo-tumbller/","title":"Elegoo Tumbller Kit","text":""},{"location":"elegoo-tumbller/#section-2","title":"Section 2","text":""},{"location":"yakasaur/","title":"Yakasaur","text":""},{"location":"yakasaur/#electronics","title":"Electronics","text":""},{"location":"yakasaur/#mechanics","title":"Mechanics","text":""},{"location":"yakasaur/#software","title":"Software","text":"<p>Sample python function </p> <p><pre><code>def sample_function()\nreturn None\n</code></pre> Another sample with line highlight taken from here - mingpt</p> mingpt<pre><code>class GPT(nn.Module):\n\"\"\" GPT Language Model \"\"\"\n@staticmethod\ndef get_default_config():\nC = CN()\n# either model_type or (n_layer, n_head, n_embd) must be given in the config\nC.model_type = 'gpt'\nC.n_layer = None\nC.n_head = None\nC.n_embd =  None\n# these options must be filled in externally\nC.vocab_size = None\nC.block_size = None\n# dropout hyperparameters\nC.embd_pdrop = 0.1\nC.resid_pdrop = 0.1\nC.attn_pdrop = 0.1\nreturn C\n</code></pre>"}]}
